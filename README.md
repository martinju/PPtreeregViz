This package was developed to visualize the Projection Pursuit
Regression Tree model
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/21/9885/pdf"></a> and add
explanatory possibilities of the model using techniques. Since
projection pursuit regression tree is based on tree method and grows
using projection of input features, the model has excellent
interpretability itself. By visualizing each node of this model, global
analysis of the model is possible. (This method is model-specific
because it can only be used in the model.) Global interpretation using
this method is possible, but it is difficult to interpret one
observation because it goes through several projections. To overcome
this, the developed techniques were slightly modified to fit the
structure of model. Using these visualization methods, it is possible to
figure out how and what features have affected the model’s prediction.
Through these processes, we can determine whether the model is
trustworthy or not.

## Installation

<a href='https://github.com/sunsmiling/PPtreeregViz'><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138.5"/></a>

You can install the released version of from CRAN with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("PPtreeregViz")
```

And the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sunsmiling/PPtreeregViz")
```

## Example Data

As an example, Boston house price data from the MASS library was used.
In the first part, we will talk about visualizing model itself. Next, we
will see an example of explaining model by applying techniques.

### Boston Data

The Boston data were divided into a train data set and a test data set
at a ratio of 7:3. In particular, the first observation in the test data
set was specifically selected as “sample_one”.

``` r
data("Boston")

set.seed(1234)
proportion = 0.7
idx_train = sample(1:nrow(Boston), size = round(proportion * nrow(Boston)))
sample_train = Boston[idx_train, ]
sample_test =  Boston[-idx_train, ]
sample_one <- sample_test[sample(1:nrow(sample_test),1),-14]
```

## Build Model & Plot Model itself

Create a model with Depth as 2 for ease of visualization and
interpretation.

``` r
library(PPtreeregViz)
Model <- PPtreeregViz::PPTreereg(medv ~., data = sample_train, DEPTH = 2)
```

``` r
plot(Model)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="80%" />

    #> NULL

Through `pp_ggparty`, marginal predicted values and actual values are
drawn according to independent variables for each final node. In the
group with the lower 25% of house prices, (lower status of the
population (percent)) had a wide range from 10 to 30, but in the group
with the top 25%, had only values less than 15.

``` r
pp_ggparty(Model, "lstat", final.rule = 1)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
pp_ggparty(Model, "lstat", final.rule = 4)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
pp_ggparty(Model, "lstat", final.rule = 5)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="80%" />

### variable importance plot

By using the combination of the regression coefficient values of the
projection values at each split node, the importance of the variables
for which the model was built can be calculated. `PPimportance`
calculate split node’s coefficients and can be drawn for each final
leaf. The blue bar represents the positive slope (effect), and the red
bar represents the negative slope.

Variables are sorted according to the overall size of each bar, so you
can know the variables that are considered important for each final node
sequentially.

``` r
Tree.Imp <- PPimportance(Model) 
plot(Tree.Imp)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="80%" />

If you use some arguments such as `marginal = TRUE` and `num_var`, you
can see the desired number of marginal variable importance of the whole
rather than each final leaf.

``` r
plot(Tree.Imp, marginal = TRUE, num_var = 5)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="80%" />

### Node visualization

`PPregNodeViz` can visualize how train data is fitted for each node.
When the node.id is 4 (i.e. first final node), the result of fitted data
is displayed in black color. In order to improve accuracy, can choose
the final rule from 1 to 5, whether to use a single value or a linear
combination of independent variables.

``` r
PPregNodeViz(Model, node.id = 1)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
PPregNodeViz(Model, node.id = 4)
#> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="80%" />

4th final leaf’s node id is 7.

``` r
PPregNodeViz(Model,node.id = 7)
#> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="80%" />

### Variable visualization

Using `PPregvarViz` shows results similar to partial dependent plots of
how independent variable affects the prediction of Y in actual data. If
the argument `Indiv=TRUE`, the picture is drawn by dividing the grid for
each final node.

``` r
PPregVarViz(Model,"lstat")
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
PPregVarViz(Model,"lstat",indiv = TRUE)
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
PPregVarViz(Model,"chas",var.factor = TRUE)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
PPregVarViz(Model,"chas",indiv = TRUE, var.factor = TRUE)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="80%" />

## Using  method

### Calculate SHAP for  method

So far, we have only seen the global movement of the model itself. From
now on, we will proceed with model analysis using SHAP values. Using the
SHAP value, you can see locally how one sample data moves in the model.
In order to calculate the SHAP value more faster, the method for
calculating the kernel shap of the package was slightly modified and
used.

``` r
sample_one
#>        crim zn indus chas  nox   rm  age    dis rad tax ptratio  black lstat
#> 177 0.07022  0  4.05    0 0.51 6.02 47.2 3.5549   5 296    16.6 393.23 10.11
```

Since the `empirical` method, which is a more accurate calculation
method, takes more time to calculate, a `simple` calculation method,
which is an estimate of this value, was used.

``` r
ppshapr.simple(PPTreeregOBJ = Model, testObs = sample_one, final.rule = 5)$dt
#>        none         crim           zn       indus        chas           nox
#> 1: 23.25114 -0.008369025 -0.007357408 0.009685125 -0.00178154 -0.0002517925
#>              rm        age        dis          rad         tax     ptratio
#> 1: -0.008369025 0.06894799 0.04018246 -0.006113893 0.009685125 0.009685125
#>           black       lstat finalLeaf
#> 1: -0.003396076 -0.04969885         3
```

Although the difference in calculation speed between and is quite large,
it can be seen that the results are similar.

### Decision plot

creates a tree based on the range of y values. Therefore, when
calculating the contributions of features of one observation, it is
natural that different values are calculated for each final leaf.
Compared with the data with y value in the lower 25% (first final leaf),
the effect of of \[`sample_one`\] was very large. On the other hand, it
can be seen that the influence of rm (average number of rooms per
dwelling) is very large in data with upper 25% large y value (4th final
leaf). How each feature affects y hat in one observation can be drawn in
two ways. `decisionplot` and `waterfallplot`.

``` r
decisionplot(Model, testObs = sample_one, method="simple",varImp = "shapImp",final.rule=5)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="80%" />

``` r
waterfallplot(Model, testObs = sample_one, method="simple", final.rule=5)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="80%" />

### Summary & Dependence plot

We would like to see how the entire SHAP values of train data move in
the model, not the effect of one observation. Since this could be quiet
computationally expensive, so it is calculated at once using .

``` r
shap_long <- ppshapr_prep(Model, final.rule = 5, method = "simple") #takes about 4 minutes
```

The summary plot visualizes how the overall features of the training
data affect the SHAP distribution. For each final leaf, a red dot means
that the feature value corresponding to that point has a high value. The
yellow color means the middle value of the feature value, and the blue
color has a lower feature value. For each leaf, features are sorted in
descending order of the SHAP’s variance. In all final leaves, rm, , and
tax had a great influence in determining the house price in common.

``` r
PPshapsummary(data_long = shap_long)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="80%" />

Through the dependency plot, for each final leaf, the effect of the
number of rooms on the house price can be seen. When the number of rooms
was 6 or less, the number of rooms did not have a significant effect on
the house price in the low house price (first final leaf), but the SHAP
value had a negative value as the number of rooms decreased in the data
corresponding to the top 25% of the house price. In other words, it can
be interpreted that in an area with a low house price, when the number
of rooms was small or average, it did not affect house price, but in an
area with a high house price, a small number of rooms had a negative
effect on the house price.

``` r
PPshapdependence(shap_long,x = "rm")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="80%" />

You can add color to see how it relates to other feature. As a result of
specifying as a color, it can be seen that the lower the and the larger
the number of rooms, SHAP values increase.

``` r
PPshapdependence(shap_long, x = "rm", color_feature = "lstat")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="80%" />

Next, as a result of examining and age, the higher contributed to the
lower house price.

``` r
PPshapdependence(shap_long,x = "crim", color_feature = "age")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="80%" />

### Collaboration with other packages

It can be collaborate with various that have already been developed (
and lime). If you use these package, you cannot see the characteristics
of each final node, but you can see the results of the entire model. The
following shows an example using the functions in the package.
