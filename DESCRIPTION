Description: This package is a tool for exploring projection pursuit regression tree,
  visualizing various projection pursuit indexes and 
  helping to understand the connection between input variables and model output using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods.
  The implemented methods help to explore the model at the single instance level as well as the whole dataset level.
  Projection pursuit regression tree models are also compatible and supported in various XAI packages developed in R.
