Description: Exploring projection pursuit regression tree with visualizing tools. 
  Showing various projection pursuit indexes and Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods can help to understand 
  the connection between input variables and model output.
  The implemented methods help to explore the model at the single instance level as well as the whole dataset level.
  Projection pursuit regression tree models are also compatible and supported in various explainable Artificial Intelligence packages developed in R.
